Okay, let's try that again with a more comprehensive and user-friendly README.md file, keeping in mind the project's purpose and potential user base. This version includes more details, sections, and potential improvements for the future.

# ai_code_prep

A Python utility to prepare codebases for AI analysis and evaluation by creating a single, flattened text file suitable for input into AI models, language models, or code analysis tools.

## Overview

`ai_code_prep` is designed to streamline the process of feeding codebases to AI systems. It intelligently extracts, formats, and packages source code into a single `.txt` file while respecting common project conventions and filtering out irrelevant content. This tool helps bridge the gap between your code repository and the input requirements of various AI-driven analysis tools.

## Key Features

*   **Respects Ignore Files:** Automatically uses `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore` to exclude unwanted files and directories from the output.
*   **File Type Filtering:** Only includes specific file extensions (e.g., `.py`, `.html`, etc.), skipping binary or unwanted file types.
*   **Virtual Environment Exclusion:** Automatically skips Python virtual environment directories (like `.venv` or `venv`).
*   **Error Handling:** Gracefully handles errors, skipping problematic files to prevent script failures.
*   **Relative Paths:** Preserves the structure of your project by using relative paths in the output file, maintaining a sense of context.
*   **Git-Style Glob Pattern Conversion:** Converts git-style glob patterns (like `/**`) to usable Python glob patterns for more accurate filtering.
*   **Clear Output:** Includes file paths, file contents and simple error messages to keep track of what the tool is doing.

## Usage

To use `ai_code_prep`, execute the script via the command line, providing your project's root directory and the desired output file path.

### Command

```bash
python ai_code_prep.py <project_root_dir> <output_file.txt>
```

### Example

```bash
python ai_code_prep.py /path/to/your/project output.txt
```

This will create an output file named `output.txt` in the same directory as the script that contains the flattened source code, formatted for AI consumption.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai_code_prep.git
    cd ai_code_prep
    ```

2.  **No Dependencies:** This script is designed to be used as is with no additional Python dependencies, using only standard library packages.

## How to Run

1.  Place the `ai_code_prep.py` script in a suitable directory on your system.
2.  Navigate to the directory of the script using your terminal.
3.  Run the script with the project root and desired output filename as arguments.

## Configuration

*   **`ignore_files`:** The script by default looks for `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore` to add files to the ignore list.
*   **`binary_extensions`:** The list of file extensions considered binary is currently hardcoded in the script.
*   **`file_extensions`:** The list of file extensions considered source code is currently hardcoded in the script.
    *   *In future versions, these will be configurable using command line arguments or an external configuration file*
